Project Description

Facial Security Theater™ is a fun, over-the-top web app that fakes facial recognition and QR scanning, complete with flashy visuals, absurd threat levels, and hilarious AI “security” logs.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Security systems don’t catch fake dangers like silly faces or imaginary threats

The Solution 
A fake AI scanner with face detection and QR codes that pretends to keep you safe—while just being hilariously dramatic.


Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

Languages used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks used:
pure front-end build

Libraries used
face-api.js – for facial detection simulation
qrious – for QR code generation
jsQR – for QR code scanning simulation

Tools used
Web browser 
VS Code
GitHub


UI Design:

1) Built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, with a cyberpunk-inspired theme and animations for “security” effects.

2) Facial Recognition Simulation:

3) Uses face-api.js to simulate face detection with random bounding boxes and funny status messages.

4) QR Code Features:

5) Generation: qrious creates random “secret” QR codes.

5) Scanning: jsQR mimics scanning by showing random decoded messages.

6) Control & Interaction:

Buttons trigger different modes—start camera, toggle face/QR scanning, run security checks, or activate panic mode.
